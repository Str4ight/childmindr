          <div class="page_text_info">
            Childmindr.net is committed to helping all of our users to stay safe.
            We remind parents that we cannot personally check the details of every childcare provider that registers with us and we remind childcare providers that they must be cautious about visiting parents in their homes or inviting strangers to visit them before background and other checks have been completed because of the potential safeguarding risks.</br></br>
            Online safety is a big issue and one which we take very seriously. Any information placed on a platform is available for public view and we recommend that members are cautious about how much personal and family information they share in their profiles.</br></br>
            We recommend you read the information below about the things we do to try and make our service as safe and secure as possible, together with what you can do stay safe and protect yourself.

        <div class="page_section">
          <div class="page_title">Profile Safety</div>
          <div class="page_text_info">
            Members can optionally create a public profile detailing their childcare requirements or childcare services. The information we request has specifically been designed to ensure maximum safety and security. For safety reasons we advise members not to include detailed personally identifiable information in their profiles such as their surname, street name, postcode, place of work, childrens names or ages. We recommend that members do not upload photos containing children for child protection reasons.

          <div class="page_title">Human Moderation</div>
          <div class="page_text_info">
            A member of our team checks all profiles before publishing them on our platform to make sure they are appropriate and do not contain offensive or inappropriate language. This might cause a short delay if we are particularly busy, but we feel it is worth the extra time to ensure that the content is suitable. Each time a profile is edited, the changes won't appear until they have been approved by a human operator.

Our safety team works 365 days a year to monitor our platform and investigate any concerns. We have a zero-tolerance policy on abusive or inappropriate use of our platform. Any member found to be acting in an inappropriate or abusive manner is permanently suspended without warning.

          <div class="page_title">Childcare Provider Reviews</div>
          <div class="page_text_info">
            Parent members are able to leave public reviews for childcare providers and the provider has the facility to respond. This promotes safety as it allows parents a voice if they have concerns about a care provider, while at the same time ensuring good practice is shared and high-quality working practices celebrated.</br></br>
            Many parents prefer the reassurance of using a childcare provider who has received multiple positive reviews.</br></br>
            If you've had a good  or bad experience of a childcare provider then please take the time to leave a childcare provider review to help other parents.

          <div class="page_title">Face to Face Interviews</div>
          <div class="page_text_info">
            Parents should always conduct face to face interviews with childcare providers before using their services. Childcare providers should never accept a job from anyone they have not met in person.

          <div class="page_title">Protecting Yourself from Scams</div>
          <div class="page_text_info">
             Unfortunately, there are some people who try to part us from our hard-earned money by scamming us online. We are all wise to spam emails and do not follow links, however inviting the offer. However, some scammers target child carers by offering money up front to care for a child ‘not currently in the country’ or ‘travelling from abroad shortly’. </br></br>
             If a job offer seems suspicious, fees seem ‘too good to be true’ or if advance payment is offered without checks having been completed, we advise all child carers to be on their guard.

          <div class="page_title">Payments sent or received to/from other Members</div>
          <div class="page_text_info">
            You should never accept payment from any member you have not met in person. A common online scam involves fraudsters sending cheques or wiring money to individuals who then request that you send the money back or use the money to buy goods to send back in the post. Similarly, you should never send money to any person you have not met in person.
