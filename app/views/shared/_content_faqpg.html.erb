                  <div class="mini_text_title colour_white_text">Do You Make Checks On Your Members?</div>
                  <div>We are an online advertising platform and do not make checks on any of our members but provide lots of information, advice and tools to allow members to undertake their own checks. Parents should do as much research as possible once they have found a childcare provider that they are interested in using. Always speak to them on the phone and arrange at least one face to face meeting, in a public place, before you use their services. Ask them as many questions as you can think of and get them to show you written proof of their qualifications, registration certificates if listed on their profile. You should ask childcare providers for references from other parents and you should verify these by contacting the person giving the reference to ensure they are genuine.</div><br/>

                  <div>The system gives parents the opportunity to rate their experience with providers by giving them 1 to 5 stars. All childcare providers start with a rating score of zero and over time averages out based on the number of stars given per rating.</div>
